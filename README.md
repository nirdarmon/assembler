Description:
    This program serves as an assembler for a custom assembly language.
    It processes source files, performs macro preprocessing, parses the code,
    and generates output files (.ob, .ent, .ext) if the source code is free of errors.
 
The assembler handles multiple files provided as arguments without the extension, processes each one,
and generates appropriate output or error messages for each file.
